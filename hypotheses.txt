(1.) We hypothesize that on average coins copy and or borrow code from newer coins over older coins.
(2.) We hypothesize that coins copy code in pieces rather than entire codebases.
(3.) We hypothesize that coins copy code from coins which have desirable traits or features. (More secure/modern cryptography, smart contract options, enhanced anonymity)
(4.) We hypothesize that coins copy code from less well-known coins (Depends on whether or not it is desired to keep code copying more or less obvious, possibly not)
