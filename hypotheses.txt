(1.) We hypothesize that there exist numerous newer coins which directly copy or borrow code from older 
     coins. (Lacking, not where we want to end up) 
(2.) We hypothesize that on average newer coins copy and or borrow code from older coins at a rate which
     is significant, say at least 75%.
(3.) We hypothesize that we will find that there will be a lot of code from newer coins that share overlap 
     with code with other coins, we will be able to show this by demonstrating partial matches, where code
     may be 75% similar or more but not exact matches. In these cases it is likely that the files will not
     necessarily be the same size. We are interested in varying levels of overlap in these cases: When 
     the files are of similar length and when they are very different in terms of length.
(4.) We hypothesize that
